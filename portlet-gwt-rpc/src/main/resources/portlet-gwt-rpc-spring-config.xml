     Use DefaultRPCServiceExporterFactory. The DefaultRPCServiceExporterFactory
     is defined in GWT SL library and is not annotated to be scanned by spring's
     component scanner (i.e., it does not have @Component or @Service
     annotation) hence explicitly declaring it here.

     Turn the compression of the GWT RPC response off. By default, the
     compression kicks off when deserialized stream size exceeds more than 256
     bytes. The compression has an issue with Spring Portlet MVC and Liferay.
     Somehow the response does not get decoded properly on the client side when
     it is compressed.
